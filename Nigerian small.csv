Mr. Ben Suleman <bensul2004nng@spinfinder.com>,R@M,"Thu, 31 Oct 2002 05:10:00 -0000",URGENT ASSISTANCE /RELATIONSHIP (P),"Dear Friend,

I am Mr. Ben Suleman a custom officer and work as Assistant controller of the Customs and Excise department Of the Federal Ministry of Internal Affairs stationed at the Murtala Mohammed International Airport, Ikeja, Lagos-Nigeria.

After the sudden death of the former Head of state of Nigeria General Sanni Abacha on June 8th 1998 his aides and immediate members of his family were arrested while trying to escape from Nigeria in a Chartered jet to Saudi Arabia with 6 trunk boxes Marked ""Diplomatic Baggage"". Acting on a tip-off as they attempted to board the Air Craft,my officials carried out a thorough search on the air craft and discovered that the 6 trunk boxes contained foreign currencies amounting to US$197,570,000.00(One Hundred and  Ninety-Seven Million Five Hundred Seventy Thousand United States Dollars).

I declared only (5) five boxes to the government and withheld one (1) in my custody containing the sum of (US$30,000,000.00) Thirty Million United States Dollars Only, which has been disguised to prevent their being discovered during transportation process.Due to several media reports on the late head of state about all the money him and his co-government officials stole from our government treasury amounting
to US$55 Billion Dollars (ref:ngrguardiannews.com) of July 2nd 1999. Even the London times of July 1998 reported that General Abacha has over US$3.Billion dollars in one account overseas. We decided to conceal this one (1)box till the situation is calm and quite on the issue. The box was thus deposited with a security company here in Nigeria and tagged as ""Precious Stones and Jewellry"" in other that its
content will not be discovered. Now that all is calm, we (myself and two of my colleagues in the operations team) are now ready to move this box out of the country through a diplomatic arrangement which is the safest means. 

However as government officials the Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us by law to operate any foreign account or own foreign investment and the amount of money that can be found in our account
cannot be more than our salary on the average, thus our handicapp and our need for your assistance to help collect and keep safely in your account this money.

Therefore we want you to assist us in moving this money out of Nigeria. We shall definitely compensate you handsomely for the assistance. We can do this by instructing the Security Company here in Nigeria to
move the consignment to their affiliate branch office outside Nigeria through diplomatic means and the consignment will be termed as Precious Stones and Jewelleries"" which you bought during your visit to Nigeria and is being transfered to your country from here for safe keeping. Then we can arrange to meet at the destination country to take the delivery of the consignment. You will thereafter open an account there and lodge the Money there and gradually instruct remittance to your Country. 

This business is 100% risk free for you so please treat this matter with utmost confidentiality .If you indicate your interest to assist us please just e-mail me for more Explanation on how we plan to execute the transaction.

Expecting your response urgently.

Best regards,

Mr. Ben Suleman

CHIEF DANIEL ELEME, PHD, EZE 1 OF ELEME.E-MAIL 
ADDRESS:obong_715@epatra.com  

ATTENTION:PRESIDENT,CEO Sir/ Madam. 

This letter might surprise you because we have met
neither in person nor by correspondence. But I believe
it is one day that you got to know somebody either in
physical or through correspondence. 

I got your contact through discreet inquiry from the
chambers of commerce and industry of your country on
the net, you and your organization were revealed as
being quite astute in private entrepreneurship, one
has no doubt in your ability to handle a financialbusiness transaction. 

However, I am the first son of His Royal
majesty,Obong.D. Eleme , and the traditional Ruler of
Eleme Province in the oil producing area of River
State of Nigeria. I am making this contact to you in
respect of US$60,000,000.00 (Sixty Million United
State Dollars), which I inherited, from my latefather. 

This money was accumulated from royalties paid to my
father as compensation by the oil firms located in our
area as a result of oil presence on our land, which
hamper agriculture, which is our major source oflivelihood. 

Unfortunately my father died from protracted
diabetes.But before his death he called my attention
and informed me that he lodged some funds on a two
boxes with a security firm with an open beneficiary
status. The lodgment security code number was also
revealed to me, he then advised me to look for a
reliable business partner abroad, that will assist me
in investing the money in a lucrative business as a
result of economic instability in Nigeria. So this is
the main reason why I am contacting you for us to move
this money from the security firm to any Country of
your choice for investment purpose. 

So I will like you to be the ultimate beneficiary, so
that the funds can be moved in your name and
particulars to any Country of your choice where it
will be claimed and invested. Hence my father have had
intimated the security firm personnel that the
beneficiary of the box is his foreign partner whose
particulars will be forwarded to the firm when due. 

But I will guide you Accordingly. As soon as the funds
reach, I will then come over to meet you in person, so
that we can discuss physically on investment
potentials. Based on this assistance my Family and I
have unanimously decided to give you 30% of the total
money, 5% for Charity home, 10% for expenses, which
may arise during this transaction, Fax and phone bills
inclusive. The balance of 55% you will invest andmanaged for my Family. 

I hereby guarantee you that this is not government
money, it is not drug money and it is not money from
arms deal. Though you have to maintain high degree of
confidentiality on this matter. I will give more
details about the proceedings of this transaction as
soon as I receive your favorable reply. 

Please reply to my Email Address:obong_715@epatra.com
I hope this will be the beginning of a prosperous
relationship between my family and your family. 

Nevertheless if you are for any reason not interested,
kindly inform me immediately so that I will look foranother contact.

Maryam Abacha <m_abacha03@www.com>,R@M,"Fri, 01 Nov 2002 01:45:04 +0100",I Need Your Assistance.,"Dear sir, 
 
It is with a heart full of hope that I write to seek your help in respect of the context below. I am Mrs. Maryam Abacha the former first lady of the former Military Head of State of Nigeria General Sani Abacha whose sudden death occurred on 8th of June 1998 as a result of cardiac arrest (heart attack) while on the seat of power. 
I have no doubt about your capability and good-will to assist me in receiving into your custody (for safety) the sum of US$25 Million willed and deposited in my favour by my late husband in a security and deposit company. Though my contact to you for this assistance is not anchored on any personal ecommendation, I pray your understanding, good will and sincere assistance to respond to this message with honest intensions and concern. 
This money is currently deposited here with a security company as miscellaneous awaiting collection and according to the agreement entered into at the time of deposit between my late husband and the Security Company at the time of deposit; the collection centre is in Ghana. As it is legally required, the administration of my late husband's properties is under the authority of the family's lawyer Tony Musa. 
 
My Dear JK, since the demise of my husband, the present regime has been probing my late husband's wealth and properties, the London Newsweek of 13th march 2000 referred. The investigating team led by Enrico Monfrini, the lawyer acting on behalf of the Nigerian government has so far submitted their report and presently, some liquid cash and assets, movable and immovable, have been frozen and seized both locally here and internationally and my last hope is rested on the immediate security of this fund in your custody. Also, Johnnie Cochran, the lawyer who defended OJ Simpson, has been brought in by the Abacha entourage to help them retain the disputed funds. Fortunately, our family lawyer had secretly protected the ""Personal will"" of my husband from the notice of the investigators and have strictly advised that the willed money be urgently moved into an overseas account of Trusted Foreign family friend without delay. For security reasons and f!
urther advise,! no relations or fr! 
iends of ours should be used; as this is a measure of security. The government had earlier placed foreign travel embargo on all our family members and seized all known local and International outfits of our business empire. 
The situation has been so terrible that we are virtually living on the assistance of well-wishers. In view of this plight, I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this ""SOS"" call to save my children and I from a hopeless future. 
I hereby agree to compensate your sincere and candid effort, immensely, which will be discussed between you, the Attorney and I. On your immediate response, the Attorney will travel to Ghana where both of you will meet, and thereafter proceed to the deposit company for the claims. 
The documentations include, most importantly, Power of Attorney and Certificate of Deposit amongst few others. These documents will be sent to you by Fax, as you would have to present them for proper claims. 
Please, be rest assured that this transaction is completely safe and legal but must be kept strictly to yourself even after the funds have been secured into our custody. This is so because any leakage of information could ruin the whole transaction. 
Please all contacts must be made through my lawyer on his email: tony_m@lawyer.com This has to be so as he has been mandated to handle this matter and I have fully briefed him (my Attorney) on my contact to you. Due to my present circumstance, I have handed everything over to him to co - ordinate and finalize with you and I will communicate you as at when necessary. Please for the safety of this transaction, reply stating your phone and fax numbers to enable them contact you directly without running the risk of mail interception. 
I look forward to your quick response. 
Best Wishes, 
Mrs. Maryam Abacha

by my colleagues of the panel to look for an oversea 
partner into whose account the sum of us$31,000 000,00 
(thirty-one million united states dollars) will be 
Paid by telegraphic transfer. Hence we are writting

We have agreed to share the money thus: 
1.  70% for us (the officials) 
2.  20% for the foreign patner(you) 
3.  10% to be used in settling taxation and local and 
Foreign expenses. 

It is this 70% that we wish to commence the 
importation business and the investment abroad. Please 
note that this transaction is 100% safe and we hope 
that the funds can arrive your account in latest 
ten(10) banking days from the date of reciept of the 
following information.A suitable company name and bank 
account(company or personel) into which the funds can 
be paid. 
   
The above information will enable us write letters 
of claim and job  description respectively. This way 
we will use your company's name to apply for payments 
and re-award the contract to your company name. 
   
We are looking foward to doing business with you and 
solicit your confidentiality  in this transaction. 
   
Please acknowledge reciept of this letter using this

MR USMAN ABDUL <abdul_817@rediffmail.com>,R@M,"Mon, 04 Nov 2002 23:41:26 -0000",THANK YOU,"CHALLENGE SECURITIES LTD.
LAGOS, NIGERIA



ATTENTION:MADAM/SIR

I am MR.USMAN ABACHA , the Director of Operations
CHALLENGE SECURITIES LTD,LAGOS NIGERIA. Here in
NIGERIA Our firm is a security company of high repute
with years of outstanding service to the people of
Africa.

I have resolved to contact you through this medium
based on business proposal that will be of mutual
benefit to both of us. I got your particulars through
a consultant company base on my research for a
trustworthy and established person that understands
investment ethic for entering into a life time
profitable joint partnership investment and also
co-operation with confidence and trust that you will
keep the contents secret and divulged to any third
party.

To be explicit and straight to the point. Some time
early 1997, a reputable client of ours deposited a
consignment in our company's vault for safe keeping.
And since then our client has failed to come forward
to claim his consignment, which has accumulated a
considerable amount of money in demurrage.

Consequently, in our bide to contact this client to
redeem the demurrage which his consignment had
accumulated we discovered that our client was the
former president of the Federal Republic of Zaire, who
died of illness after he was de-throwed in the same
year the consignment was entrusted into our care.

Since the death of our client President Mobutou
Seseseko, none of his benefactors has come forward to
claim the consignment with us, which means that non of
his relatives or aids had any knowledge of this
consignment. Hence out of curiosity I decided to
secretly open the two boxes that our client deposited
in our vault. And to my surprise I discovered that the
two boxes that were registered as treasurer by our
client actually contained a considerable amount of
money in United States Dollars amounting to about
US$30 million Dollar. Since this development I have
been nursing plans secretly. I also found out from
enquiries and the foreign media that our late client
siphoned a lot of money from his country while he was
in office as head of state.

It is my conviction that the consignment in our vault
was part of the money that our client siphoned and now
that he is dead there is no race to this money in our
care.

I am now soliciting your noble assistance to assist me
in transferring this money out of nigeria to your
country for immediate investment with your assistance.
I have also decided that you will generously be
entitled to 30% of the total amount. Upon my receipt
of your reply confirming your willingness to assist me
of this transaction, I will immediately arrange and
transfer all the rights of ownership of this
consignment to your name to facilitate your easy
clearance and transfer of the complete funds to your
country.

you have nothing to worry about, as I will  be there
to assist you in anyway necessary with all proper
documentation.

This transaction is 100% risk free.

Please maintain absolute confidentiality on this
matter.


Thanks.

Yours faithfully.

MR. USMAN ABDUL

memory, may his soul rest in peace.
 
Due to the military campaign of LAURENT KABILA to
force out the rebels in my country, I and some of my
colleagues were instructed by Late President Kabila
to  go abroad to purchase arms and ammunition worth of
Twenty Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars only (US$20,500,000.00) to fight the rebel group. But when President Kabila was killed in a bloody shoot-out by one of his aide a day before we were schedule to travel out of Congo, We immediately  decided to divert the fund into a private security company here in Congo for safe keeping. The security of the said amount is presently being threatened here following the arrest and seizure of properties of Col. Rasheidi Karesava (One of the aides to Laurent Kabila) a tribesman, and some other Military Personnel from our same tribe, by the new President of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the son of late President Laurent Kabila, Joseph Kabila. 
In view of this, we need a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who can assist us to move this money out of my country as the beneficiary.
WE have sufficient ''CONTACTS'' to move the fund under Diplomatic Cover to a security company in the europe in your name. This is to ensure that the Diplomatic Baggage is marked ''CONFIDENTIAL'' and it  will not pass through normal custom/airport screening and clearance.
Our inability to move this money out of Congo all
This while lies on our lack of trust on our supposed good friends (western countries) who suddenly became hostile to those of us who worked with the late President Kabila, immediately after his son took office. Though we have neither seen nor met each other, the information We gathered from an associate
who has worked in your country has encouraged and convinced us that with your sincere assistance, this transaction will be properly handled with modesty
and honesty to a huge success within two weeks. The said money is a state fund and therefore requires a total confidentiality.
Thus, if you are willing to assist us move this fund out of Congo, you can contact me through my email address above with your telephone, fax number and personal information to enable us discuss the modalities and what will be your share
(percentage) for assisting us.
I must use this opportunity and medium to implore You to exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this Matter extraordinarily confidential, Whatever your Decision, while I await your prompt response. Thank you and GodBless.

THE MANAGER
Headquarter,
First Bank of Nigeria Plc.
Lagos, Nigeria.
Alternative E-mail: sam01jordan@yahoo.com
Sir,

Compliment of the day and how is life general with
you? Of course it is my humble wish to solicit and
crave your indulgence to make this project request for
a joint business transaction which I hope will not
come to you as a surprise, hence I plead for
your pardon.

I am Dr.Sam Jordan, the  Manager of headquarter
First Bank of Nigeria Plc. Lagos. I have an urgent and
confidentialbusiness proposal for you. 

On June 6, 1998, an Italian oil
consultant/contractor with via National Petroleum
cooperation (NNPC) Mr. Paul Bush made a numbered time
(fixed) deposit for twelve calenderer month valued at
US$43.7,000.00 in my branch.

On maturity, I sent a routine notification to his
forwarded address but got no reply after months we
send a reminder and finally we discovered from his
contract employee (Nigeria national petroleum
Corporation) that Mr. Paul Bush died from an
automobile accident. On further investigation, it was
clear  that he died without making a will. All
attempts by the Australian to trace his next of
kin were fruitless.

I therefore made further investigation and discovered
that Mr. Paul Bush did not declare any next of kin or
relations in all his official documents including his
deposit document in my bank. The total sum
US$43.7,000,000.00 is still in my bank as dormant
acct.
No one will ever come forward to claim it. According
to Nigerian banking law, after five years, the money
will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian
Government. If the account owner is certified death
and nobody comes forward to claim it.

This is the situation , and my proposal is that I am
looking for a foreigner who will stand in as the
beneficiary/next of kin. This is simple. All you have
to do is to immediately send me the details of a bank
account anywhere in the world for me to arrange the
proper money transfer document. The money will then be
transferred into the account for us to share in the
ration of 60% for me 30% for you while the remaining
10% will be set aside for expenses incurred with
here and there.

There is no risk involved. I am using my position and
connection in the bank here to do all the document
work for the transaction. We shall employ the services
of an attorney to draft the will and obtain all
necessary documents and letter of administration in
your fovour for the transfer. This transaction is risk
free guaranteed. If you are interested, please reply
immediately confidentiality and be rest assured that
this transaction could be most profitable for both of
us. Please do not expose this deal if you are not
interested because if you do, it will take me out
of seat.Please expenses is involve in this
business,phone/fax number,and your bank particulars.

I am awaiting your urgent reply.

Best regards,

Dr.Sam Jordan.

the security company does not know the true content of
the boxes.This money was originally meant to be used
for his political campaign. Because I was his family
Attorney as such he confided in me with the
relevant document papers relating to this deposit
before he died of cardiac arrest.

As a matter of fact we have concluded all arrangement
with an offshore Security Company to move this money as
a consignment through diplomatic means to their
offshore affiliated office where you will be required
to put claim to the consignment as the bonafide
beneficiary of the consignment. You should know that
this business is safety and 100% risk-free as it

          Johannesburg,South Africa.

My Dear ,

Good day.This very confidential request should come as a surprise to you.But it is because of the nature of what is happening to me and my family urged me to contact you, and I quite understand that this is not the best way to contact you because of the nature of my request and the attention it requires.I got your contact information from your country's information directory during my desperate search for someone who can assist me secretly and confidentially in relocating and managing some family fortunes.

My name is Mr.Michael Kamah, the second son of Mr.Smith  Kamah, of Beitbridge Zimbabwe.At the height of the present political crises in our country,in which the white farmers in our country are being slained and ripped off their belongings by the supporters of our president,Mr.Robert G.Mugabe,in their efforts to reclaim all the white owned farms in our country,my father and my elder brother were brutally slained to a painful death on the 13th of february,2002, in their struggle to protect some white farmers who ran to take refuge in our house.My father,during his life on earth was a prominent business man who trades on diamond and gold from some foreign countries .He publicly opposes the crude policies and crime against humanity on the white farmers by Mr.Robert Mugabe and his followers,which they enforced media law restrictions to protect their wicked acts.That not being enough,the president and his followers after winning the last undemocratic elections decided to block an!
d confiscate all accounts and assets of our black indigenes[that included my fathers assets and accounts] who oppose his policies and render support to these white farmers,along with the assets of these white farmers themselves,that are being presently confiscated.I therefore decided to move my mother and younger sister to the Republic of South Africa,where we presently live without anything and without any source of livelyhood.

During my fathers life on earth,he had deposited the sum of Seven Million and Four Hundred Thousand United States Dollars[$7.400.000.00],in a trunk box with a Finance and Security Company in the Republic of Togo for a cash and carry Diamond and Gold business with some foreign business customers, awaiting instructions to be moved to its destination,which he never completed before he met his untimely death on that faithful day.In view of this and as the only surviving son of my father,and with the present clamp down,killing and confiscation of his assets as one of those who render support to the white farmers in our country,I therefore humbly wish to inform you of my intentions to use your name and adress in making sure that this fund is lifted out of Africa finally,to the Europe office of the finance company and also seek for your honest and trustworthy assistance to help me clear and accommodate this money over there before it is dictated out and blocked by the present Mugab!
e's regime.My mother is presently with the valid document covering this deposit.

Now this is what I actually want you to do for me;

1. I want you to be presented to the Finance and Security company as the person I contacted to assist my family for this purpose, with whose name and adress myself and my mother will forward to them their office in the Republic of Togo as the person that will clear this money when they lift it out to their europe office.
2. To finally assist me in accommodating and managing this money in any lucrative business in your country for at least three years. 

Please,I hope you will grant and view this very request with favour and much understanding of our situation now,and will be a very honest and reliable person to deal with.And also bearing in mind the confidential nature of this my request,I emphasize please that you keep every bit of it to yourself so as to protect my familys future and yourself rendering this help.Thanking you in anticipation of your urgent response as soon as you read this very request.

Best Regards, 

Mr.Michael Kamah and family.

A Very Good day to you   

I am Mrs Mariam Abacha. I got your contact from a
close Associate of mine who works with the Nigerian
Chamber of Commerce and Industry  who visited your
country for an International Trade Fair upon my quest
for a trusted and reliable foreign businessman or
company. 
He however gave me the assurance that you can be
trusted to handle a transaction of this magnitude.
Following the sudden death of my husband General Sani
Abacha the late Former Head of State of Nigeria in
1998, I have been thrown into a state of utter
confusion, frustration and hopelessness 
by the present civilian administration, I have been
subjected to physical and psychological torture by the
security agents in the country. 
As a widow that is so traumatized, I have lost
confidence with anybody within the country. You must
have heard over the media reports and the internet on
the recovery of various huge sums of money deposited
by my husband in different security firms abroad, some
companies willingly give up their secrets and
disclosed our money confidently lodged there or many
outright blackmail. In fact the total sum discovered
by
 the Government so far is in the tune of $700. Million
dollars. And they are not relenting to make me poor
for life. I will give you more information  as to this
regard as soon as you reply. I repose great confidence
in you hence my approach to you due to security
network placed on my day to day  affairs I cannot
afford to visit the embassy so that is why I decided
to contact you and I hope you will not betray my
confidence in you. I have deposited  the sum of US$35
million dollars with a security firm abroad whose name
is withheld for now until we open communication. I
shall be grateful if you could receive this fund into
your account for safekeeping. This arrangement is
known to you and my family lawyer who shall deal
directly with you as I am still under house arrest. I
am seriously considering to settle down abroad as soon
as this fund get into your account so that I can start
all over again if only you wish, but if it is
possible, 
just help me in diverting this funds into your bank
account which will accrue you 20% of this fund. Please
honesty is the watchword in this transaction. And
should you accept my terms, kindly send me an email
signifying your interest to my email box as this is
only safe for me now so that we can commence
 communication immediately. And upon receipt of your
message of interest, I shall give you a more detailed
picture of things. In case you don't accept please do
not let me out to the security as I am giving you this
information in total trust and confidence.NO RISK IS
INVOLVED AS IAM STILL IN CONTROL OF MY HUSBANDS
AFFAIRS. I will greatly appreciate if you accept my
proposal in good faith. 

Please expedite action.

which the bank now unquestionably expects to be claimed by any of his available foreign next of kin or alternatively be donated to a discredited trust fund for arms and ammunition at a military war collage here in Nigeria.

 Fervent valuable efforts are being made by the Union Bank to get in touch with any of late Engr. William Adams's next of kin (he had no known wife and children) that the management under the influence of our chairman, board of directors, Retired Major General Kalu Uke Kalu, that an arrangement for the fund to be declared ""UNCLIAMABLE "" and then be subsequently donated to the trust fund for Arms and Ammunition, which will further enhance the
course of war in Africa and the world in general. In order to avert this negative development, myself and some of my trusted colleagues in the bank now seek for your permission to have you stand as late Engr.WILLIAMS ADAMSs next of kin so that the fund, USD$22.2M, would be subsequently transferred and paid into your bank account as the
beneficiary next of kin. All documents and proves to enable you get this fund have been carefully worked out and we are assuring you a 100% risk free involvement.

AN URGENT BUSINESS PROPOSAL 

I am pleased to get across to you for a very urgent and profitable Business proposal, though I don't know you neither have I seen you before but my confidence was reposed on you when the Chief Executive of Lagos State chamber of Commerce and Industry handed me your contact for a confidential business. I am a Staff of United Bank
for Africa (UBA),Ilupeju branch, Lagos Nigeria.

The intended business is thus; we had a customer, a Foreigner (a Turkish) resident in Nigeria, he was a Contractor with one of the Government Parastatals. He has in his Account in my branch the sum of US$21.5 Million (Twenty One Million Five Hundred ThousandU.S.Dollars).Unfortunately, the man died four years ago until today non-of his next of kin has come forward to claim the money. Having noticed this, I in collaboration with two other top Officials of the bank we have covered up the account all this while.

Dear Sir, 

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL & URGENT.

I am Mr George Mboro , a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an Executive Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining & Natural Resources. First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. Be informed that a member of the South Africa Export Promotion Council (SEPC) who was at the Government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition gave your enviable credentials/particulars to me.

I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the nature of this transaction. Within the Department of Mining & Natural Resources where I work as an Executive Accountant and with the cooperation of four other top officials, we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Eighteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars (US$18,500,000.00) which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole transaction.

This amount (US$18.5m) represents the balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Telegraphic Transfer (T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an application through the Justice Ministry here in South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you. I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in the transaction, your share of the sum will be 30% of the US$18.5 million, 60% for us and 10% for taxation and miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100% safe, on your part provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality. Also your area of specialization is not a hind!
rance to the successful execution of this transaction.

 I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint me. Endeavor to contact me immediately through my above tel/fax number ,or my email address:mboro@accountant.com whether or not you are interested in this deal. If you are not, it will enable me contact other another Foreign partner with recommendation to carry out this deal. I want to assure you that myself and my partners are in a position to make the payment of this claim possible provided you can give us a very strong assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured and Please remember to treat this matter as very confidential matter; because we will not comprehend with any form of exposure as we are still in active Government Service and remember once again that time is of the essence in this business. 

I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation. I am available to entertain any questions concerning the clarity of this transaction.

 Yours faithfully,

Mr  George  Mboro

Attn:President/Ceo. 

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS PROPOSAL 
RE: TRANSFER OF US$21.5 MILLION (TWENTY ONE MILLION, 
FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND US DOLLARS ONLY). 

I know this email will reach you as a surprise, but need not to worry 
as we are using the only secured and confidential medium available to 
seek for foreign assistance/partnership in a business transaction 
which is of mutual benefit. 

I am a member of the Federal Government of Nigeria Contract Award and 
Monitoring Committee in the Nigeria National Petroleum 
Corporatio(NNPC). Sometime ago, a contract was awarded to a foreign 
firm in NNPC by my Committee. This contract was over invoiced to the 
tune of US$21.5M. U.S. Dollars. This was done deliberately. The 
over-invoicing was a deal by my committee to benefit from the 
project. We now want to transfer this money which is in a suspense 
Account with NNPC into any Overseas Account which we expect you to 
provide for us. 

SHARE: - 
For providing the account where we shall remit the money into, you 
will be entitled to 30% of the money,60% will be for me andmy 
partners while 10% has been mapped out from the total sum to cover 
any expenses that maybe incurred by us during the course of this 
transfer,both locally and international expenses. 
I would require the following: - 

. Your company's name,address,telephone and fax numbers. 
The above information would be used to make formal applications as a 
matter of procedure for the release of the money and onward transfer 
to your account. 
It does not matter whether or not your company does contract projects 
of this nature described here. The assumption is that your company 
won the major contract and subcontracted it out to other companies. 
More often than not,big trading companies or firms of unrelated 
fields win major contracts and subcontracts to more specialized firms 
for execution of such contracts. 

We have strong reliable connections and contacts at the Central Bank 
of Nigeria, as well as the Federal Ministry of Finance and we have no 
doubt that all the money will be released and transferred if we get 
the necessary foreign partner to assist us in this deal. 
Therefore,when the business is successfully concluded we shall 
through our same connections withdraw all documents used from all the 
concerned Government Ministries for 100% security. 

We are ordinary civil servants and we will not want to miss this once 
in a lifetime opportunity to get rich. We want this money to be 
transferred to the overseas Accounts for us, before the present 
Democratic Government start Auditing all Federal Government owned 
Parastatals. 

Please contact me immediately through my telephone number whether or 
not you are interested in this deal.If you are not,it will enable me 
scout for another foreign partner to carry out this deal. Butwhere 
you are interested,send the required documents aforementioned herein 
through my above telephone number,or 
email:edema_ma@mauimail.com,because time is of the essence in this 
business. 
I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation. 

Yours faithfully, 
Edema Martins.

          Johannesburg,South Africa.

My Dear ,

Good day.This very confidential request should come as a surprise to you.But it is because of the nature of what is happening to me and my family urged me to contact you, and I quite understand that this is not the best way to contact you because of the nature of my request and the attention it requires.I got your contact information from your country's information directory during my desperate search for someone who can assist me secretly and confidentially in relocating and managing some family fortunes.

My name is Mr.Michael Kamah, the second son of Mr.Smith  Kamah, of Beitbridge Zimbabwe.At the height of the present political crises in our country,in which the white farmers in our country are being slained and ripped off their belongings by the supporters of our president,Mr.Robert G.Mugabe,in their efforts to reclaim all the white owned farms in our country,my father and my elder brother were brutally slained to a painful death on the 13th of february,2002, in their struggle to protect some white farmers who ran to take refuge in our house.My father,during his life on earth was a prominent business man who trades on diamond and gold from some foreign countries .He publicly opposes the crude policies and crime against humanity on the white farmers by Mr.Robert Mugabe and his followers,which they enforced media law restrictions to protect their wicked acts.That not being enough,the president and his followers after winning the last undemocratic elections decided to block an!
d confiscate all accounts and assets of our black indigenes[that included my fathers assets and accounts] who oppose his policies and render support to these white farmers,along with the assets of these white farmers themselves,that are being presently confiscated.I therefore decided to move my mother and younger sister to the Republic of South Africa,where we presently live without anything and without any source of livelyhood.

During my fathers life on earth,he had deposited the sum of Seven Million and Four Hundred Thousand United States Dollars[$7.400.000.00],in a trunk box with a Finance and Security Company in the Republic of Togo for a cash and carry Diamond and Gold business with some foreign business customers, awaiting instructions to be moved to its destination,which he never completed before he met his untimely death on that faithful day.In view of this and as the only surviving son of my father,and with the present clamp down,killing and confiscation of his assets as one of those who render support to the white farmers in our country,I therefore humbly wish to inform you of my intentions to use your name and adress in making sure that this fund is lifted out of Africa finally,to the Europe office of the finance company and also seek for your honest and trustworthy assistance to help me clear and accommodate this money over there before it is dictated out and blocked by the present Mugab!
e's regime.My mother is presently with the valid document covering this deposit.

Now this is what I actually want you to do for me;

1. I want you to be presented to the Finance and Security company as the person I contacted to assist my family for this purpose, with whose name and adress myself and my mother will forward to them their office in the Republic of Togo as the person that will clear this money when they lift it out to their europe office.
2. To finally assist me in accommodating and managing this money in any lucrative business in your country for at least three years. 

Please,I hope you will grant and view this very request with favour and much understanding of our situation now,and will be a very honest and reliable person to deal with.And also bearing in mind the confidential nature of this my request,I emphasize please that you keep every bit of it to yourself so as to protect my familys future and yourself rendering this help.Thanking you in anticipation of your urgent response as soon as you read this very request.

Best Regards, 

Mr.Michael Kamah and family.

 BUSINESS PROPOSAL

Dear sir / Madam 


My name is DR, ADAMS OBOZUWA., a member of the Presidential 
Task Force on Oil Spillage Clean-up. Early last year there 
was a major oil spillage in the Niger Delta Region of 
Nigeria which rendered over 70% of the communities 
homeless.The contract was handled by a foreign firm but 
because of the huge monetary profit we envisaged we decided 
to over-invoice the contract sum. Now the contract has been 
completed and the original contractor has since been 
paid,but the contract balance of US$38 million,which 
resulted from the over invoiced contract sum that has been 
left in a suspense account with the DEBT RECONCILIATION 
COMMITTEE A SUBSIDIARY OF THE APEX BANK,is what me and my 
partners are planning to take out of the country for 
ourselves.The problem is as government officials,we are not 
suppose to own fat bank accounts,talk less of having 
foreign ones.To this end, we are soliciting your assistance 
as a foreign partner who can assist us and receive this 
amount into your account. We are ready to share this money 
with you on the basis of participation. We also have plans 
to invest part of this money in any viable business in your 
country under your care,as we are nearing our retirement 
age. In any case, I received a reference of 
you/organization from the Nigeria Chambers of Commerce and 
Industry Foreign Trade Division as a reputable organ that 
can assist us on this transaction. Please if you accept my 
proposal do not hesitate to send me a fax on 234 1 759 0379 
or send me an e-mail on: 
adamuohiroma, so that I can provide you with the basic 
procedures for the release of the fund. It does not matter 
whether you or your company does contract project of the 
nature described here, the assumption is that you won a 
major contract and subcontracted it to another company, 
more often than not, big trading companies or individuals 
of unrelated field win major contracts here in Nigeria and 
subcontracts same to more specialized firms for execution. 
BENEFIT For providing the account where we shall remit this 
money, you will be entitled to 25% of the entire funds, 70% 
will be for me and my partners,while 5% has been set aside 
to cover any expenses that may be incurred by both parties 
during this transaction, both local and international. 
Please I enjoin you to handle this transaction with utmost 
degree of maturity and confidentiality because I am still 
in active government service with the NIGERIAN NATIONAL 
PETROLEUM CORPORATION. If I receive your response on time, 
this whole transaction could be accomplished within the 
shortest possible time based on your interest and 
determination,since the money is already in transit. 
Please, try to call me up to confirm the receipt of your 
fax or e-mail.The lines may be busy,but keep trying till 
you get through. 

Yours faithfully, 

DR, ADAMS OBOZUWA. (MNIM)

MR FRED OBI. <fredobi3@omaninfo.com>,,"Wed, 27 Nov 2002 13:45:46 +0100",URGENT BUSINESS TRUSTEE,"TRANSFER OF USD$22MILLION INTO YOUR ACCOUNT}

ATTENTION: President\\CEO.

I, on behalf of my other colleagues from different
organs of Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) owned
parastatals decided to solicit your assistance as
regards transfer of the above-mentioned amount into
your bank account.  This fund accrued from over
invoicing of various contract awarded in my parastatal
to certain Foreign Contractors sometimes ago.

We, as holders of sensitive position in our various
parastatals, were mandated by the Federal Government
to Scrutinise all payments made to certain foreign
Contractors and we discovered that some of the
contracts they executed were grossly over-invoiced
either by omission or commission.  In the process the
sum of US$27M (Twenty Seven Million US Dollars only)
was found lying in the parastatal suspense account
after the foreign contractors had been paid their
rightful dues for executing the said contracts.

We all agreed that this over-invoiced amount be
transferred (for our own use) into a bank account
provided by a foreign partner, because we are
government workers and the Code of Conduct does not
allow us to operate foreign accounts.

However, we have succeeded in transferring some of
this money precisely US$5.0M (Five Million US Dollars
only) into a foreign account in MOROCCO (North
Africa), but the provider of the account in MOROCCO is
up to some mischief and refuses to comply to the
earlier mutual agreement by insisting that the total
amount be paid into his nominated bank account before
disbursement will take effect.  If for a meagre sum of
US$5.0M (Five Million US Dollars only) we are not
compensated, is it when the balance of US$22M
(Twenty-two Million US Dollars)is transferred that we
will be sure of our full compensation? Of course, this
abuse of trust and inhumanity calls for sober
reflection and search for absolute trust.

Thus we are seeking your unwavering assistance that
the remaining amount of US$22M can be speedily
processed and fully remitted into your nominated bank
account.  On successful remittance of the fund into
your account, you will be compensated with 30% of the
amount for your assistance and services.

So far, much have been said and due to our sensitive
positions, we cannot afford a slip in this transaction
neither can we give out identity as regards our
respective offices, but whereby cordial relationship
is established, smooth operations commences, you will
be furnished with details of all you deserves to know.

I am at your disposition to entertain any question
from you with respect to this transaction, so contact
me immediately through my e:mail for further
information on the requirements and procedure for this
transaction.

Please, treat with the strictest confidentiality and
utmost urgency.

Yours faithfully,

this mail might cause you.
I am MAHOYI BELLO, a cousin to the Vice Presidentof
the Federal Republic of Nigeria (Alhaji Atiku) and
Executive Director of SADIQ PETROLUEM LTD.I have
decided to contact you for this business proposal
based on the mutual understanding I know that can
exist between us, having known that people of your

Since May 1999 when the new Government came to
power,large sums of money have been recovered from our
past military leaders who siphoned money from Nigeria
and deposited it in offshore accounts in
Europe,America,Asia and some parts of Africa, for
their own selfish benefits. This happened during the
military regime,Now we are under a democratically
elected government. This fund was among the money
recovered and seized by the Federal Government of
Nigeria. 

Hence, my elder cousin (Alhaji Atiku Abubakar) the
Vice-President of Nigeria is in charge of all
off-shore accounts seized and retrieved from our past
military leaders.Therefore, we urged you to assist us
provide a very vital offshore account, where the sum
of US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty Five Million) US Dollars
will be transferred for safe keeping. 

Presently, this money is in a foreign Country I cannot
mention now.Please note that other information will be
detailed to you on the receipt of your reply. My
elder cousin and I have agreed to give you (the
account owner)for this transaction 30% of the total
amount remitted while 60%is for me and Cousin Atiku,
for the purchase of foreign investments, with your
assistance after the money have been disbursed, while
10% is for expenses both of us will incur.

Note, I have been mandated by my elder cousin to
handle this deal with you, due to his position in the
Nigerian Government as the second citizen. Therefore,
if my proposal satisfies you, kindly contact me via my
e-mail address and enclose your phone and fax numbers
for urgent confidential discussion.Your letter of
acceptance indicating your personal telephone and fax
numbers to enable us move ahead.

Besides, this transaction is risk-free and hoped to

Mr. David Agu <adgua@mail.com>,webmaster@aclweb.org,"Tue, 03 Dec 2002 19:47:42 -0000",INHERITANCE CLAIM,"ATTN:MANAGING DIRECTOR

I am writing this proposal hoping that you would be of assistance in this business of mutual benefit. My name is Mr.David Agu an auditor at one of the Federal Ministries in lagos-Nigeria. 

During our last audit exercise,some amount of money totalling $16.5Million was discovered and traced to be owned by one late Engineer Muller Robert, a foreigner who died in a plane crash. The source of this fund was further traced to be a contract payment made to him but has remained unclaimed till now.Since his death, nobody has shown up to claim this fund and this attracted my curiosity. 

I therefore made a research and found out that he did not leave any next of kin in his confidential document with the ministry that he executed the contract for. A panel setup by the Federal Government on recovery of funds expects that this fund should be unquestionably claimed by any of his available foreign next of kin or alternatively the fund should be donated for arms and ammunition at a military war college here in Nigeria. Fervent valuable efforts were made by the Panel to get in touch with any of the family or relatives but all have proved to no avail.

It is because of the perceived possibility of not going to be able to locate any next of kin ( he had no wife and children) that the panel under the influence of our chairman, Rtd Major General Usman Bello, that arrangement is being made for the fund to be declared UNCLAIMABLED and then be donated to the Trust Fund for arms and ammunition which will further enhance the perpetration of war in Africa and the third world in general. To forestall this move, my colleagues and I have taken it upon ourselves to source for a foreign partner who could assist in claimimg this fund for further transfer abroad. 

I have been given the sole mandate to source for a partner as soon as possible to that effect.All documents and proof to enable you get this fund have been carefully worked out and I am assuring you a 100% risk free involvement. Your share would be 30% of the total amount if you agree to assist while 10% would be set aside to offset all expenses in course of the transfer and the rest would be for us for investment purposes in your country. 

If this proposal is OK by you, and you do wish to take the advantage of the trust we hope to bestow on you and your company, then kindly reach me immediately via Fax:234-1-7597019 furnishing me with your most confidential telephone and fax numbers and exclusive email so that I can forward to you the relevant details of the transaction. I expect your urgent response.

Dear Friend,


 My name is DR,IDRIS BELLO, a member of the Presidential 
Task Force on Oil Spillage Clean-up.
 Early last year there was a major oil spillage in 
the Niger Delta Region of Nigeria which rendered over 70% 
of the communities homeless.
 A contract was awarded to a foreign firm to 
rehabilitate the communitties, because of the huge monetary 
profit I envisaged, we decided to over-invoice the contract 
sum.

 Now the contract has been completed and the original 
contractor has long been paid,but the contract
 balance of THIRTY EIGHT MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS
(US$38 MILLION),which resulted from the over invoiced
 contract sum has been left in a suspense account with the 
DEBT RECONCILIATION COMMITTEE,A SUBSIDIARY OF OUR APEX BANK,
 This over invoice sum is what we intend to take out of 
the country for ourselves.

The problem is as government officials,we are not suppose 
to own fat bank accounts,talk less of having foreign ones.
 To this end, we are soliciting your assistance as a 
foreign partner who can assist us and receive this amount 
into your account.

 We are ready to share this money with you on the basis 
of participation.
we also have plans to invest part of this money in any 
viable business in your country under your care,as we are 
nearing our retirement age.

 In any case, I received a reference of you/organization 
from the Nigeria Chambers of Commerce and Industry Foreign 
Trade Division
as a reputable organ that can assist us on this transaction.

provide you with the
basic procedures for the release of the fund.

contract project of the nature described here, the 
assumption is that you won a major contract and 
subcontracted it to another company, more often than

firms for execution.

 The BENEFIT For providing the account where we shall remit

REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS TRANSACTION. 
Dear Sir,

reliable foreign company through which we can transfer the sum of Thirty
Five Million United States Dollars Only (US$35,000,000). This fund is deposited
in the Corporation Treasury account with the Apex Bank.

This sum arose from the deliberated over-invoicing of a contract awarded
by my ministry Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation to foreign firm in
the twinlight days of the last military regime. This contract has been completely
executed and commissioned and the contractor that handled this contract
has collected his full and final payment thus leaving behind the above stated
amount which represent the over invoiced sum. We have been safeguarding
this money for conducive time for it's transfer out of the country for our
personal use. However, the code of employment does not allow us (civil servant)
to own and operate foreign account and because the contract was handled
by a foreign firm and the payment made in dollars, we now need a foreign
partner that will present himself as the sub-contractor so that the fund
will be transfer into your company's or personal account. Your address was
made available to us by a very good friend who work with the Nigeria export
promotion council and he assured us of your company's viability and capability
in business transaction. This assurance gave us the courage to link you
up in this particular transaction and I hope it will be of mutual benefit
to all of us. Note that the nature of your business is not particularly
relevant to the success of the transaction. All we require is your willingness
to present yourself as the subcontractor by providing your bank information
so that the fund will be transferred into your account. 
SHARING RATIO:
 For your assistance in this business , your share will be 30% of the total
fund. I and my colleagues will take 60% while we set aside 10% for any expenses
that may incurred in the course of this transaction. If you are willing
to assist us in this business. Send the following information. 
1. Name of your bank and address 
2. Your account number/beneficiarys name. 
3. Your private telephone and fax number for easy communication. 
This information will enable us put an application for payment approval
to the concerned Ministries and final to the Senate Committee on Contract
Payment and it is going to last for fourteen working days starting from
the day we receive the above information. All modalities for the take off
of this transaction have been worked out and further action will commence
immediately we hear from you. I am waiting for your reply by fax on this
fax number :234-1-7592865 as stated above. 
Yours faithfully.

CLEMENT APUTE <clem-apute@consultant.com>,R@M,"Thu, 05 Dec 2002 19:03:38 -0800",PARTNERSHIP,"Subject: BUSINESS PROPOSAL

Importance: HIGH


Good day,
 This might seem very deplorable for a person that you do not know. My name is Clement Apute,I am a lawyer and a very close confidant to my client who also happens to be my sister-in-law.
 
I am contacting you because of the my client's urgent need to go into partnership with someone,who is not from this country, as a result of their family's present situation in the country,and specifically because you have a fixed address or let me say fixed responsibilities, which can stands as a good reason to go into partnership with you. 

The present situation right now, requires good understanding and a good sense of judgment.

My sister-in-law and her entire family are really suffering from the hands of some wicked people who are drunk with power.This is just a personal vendetta by the head of states, because he was jailed by my client husband's regime in 1997, for actually plotting a coup d 'etat against their military administration then, when they were in power. 

It is very clear that our present head of states wants to take advantage of his seat in power to settle his personal hatred for my client's family.

This man is bent on destroying my client's family. The family has virtually lost all their family's money and properties due to this vindictive administration in power now. who are bent on dealing with the family.

All their bank accounts have been frozen,assets and their properties which I helped in managing have been confiscated and are still non functional till this present day.
 His administration has spread so much rumors against their family, which is yet another smear campaign aimed mainly to frustrate, humiliate, dismember and widen the scope of
hatred to my client's family. 

Right now it is completely impossible for any member of the family to make any move because the entire family are being placed under traveling restrictions.About a few months ago we were squished out of another US$395 million dollars, and these wicked people have completely dammed the fact that all this funds can be ascertained for independently.
 
Presently, the family is finding it very hard to manage as we have completely run out of resources, because everything has been taken away from madam and her children. My client needs sombody that she can confide in,presently the family still has some amounts of money to the sum of 84 million US dollars and some fractions in cash,which the family has spread out and lodged in the vault of different Securities outfits in two countries there in Asia and also in Europe.

The existence of these monies is not in any way known to anybody else,not even all mama's children, apart from her eldest son. The money was lodged in as jewelry. This is a precaution to maintain a very high level secrecy, because this is all the family have left to fall back on. So we expect you to keep this matter in confidence.

Madam wants a partner to proceed as soon as possible and retrieve some money lodged in any of this security outfits and handle it as duly instructed. The family needs somebody to help them withdraw there deposits because the family is financially down here in the country, since everything they own here have been taken away from them. We are looking for an understanding partner that can work with us. 

All we require from you is to help the family
to go and retrieve any one of the family's deposits that is lodged in one of these places and keep safely in your care, since none of us is able to travel out of this country due to traveling restrictions.

Secondly,so that you can always withdraw little part out of their money that will be in your possession and send it down here to us here,anytime the family is in great need. In this way they can continue to sustain the family until they are free from thier enemies.
 As their lawyer i will be instructing, on how you will go about that. We will be providing you with
all the legal documents to make claim on behalf of my client. 
Please be rest assured that you will have no problems or difficulties in claiming any of these deposits because nobody is aware of the existence of this money. All the details will be given to you when we open up negotiations and arrive at a reasonable compromise and until I gain your trust to see that we can work together.

 We will negotiate on a certain percentage share of the money that the family will offer to you for your expected assistance and partnership. 

Please do inform me on your decision immediately, so as to stop further contacts. I await your response. NOTE - You can also get in contact with me via my secured
email:clem-aputa@earthling.net
 
I will like to have your private phone number so that we can discuss better. 

Regards, 


Clement Apute. Esq.

I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 1997, a FOREIGN Oil Consultant/Contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Roger Berget made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$8,000,000.00 (Eight Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, Ministry of Defence headquater in Abuja that Mr. Roger Berget died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin to date has fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Roger Berget did not declare any kin or relations in!
 all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$8,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as an Foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Roger Berget so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names, address, telephone and fax numers so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the service of two Attorneys for drafting and not!
arization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world, which you will provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your nominated account for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me, 25% for you and 5% to cover any accidental expenses on either sides during the course of this transaction. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via this email address. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction better. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transactio!
n would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Looking forward to hearing from you soonest.

Please note that I can not open any Bank account with  my name because, My late husband's first  son-JOSEPH-who took over power in our country, don't  want to see me and my children, He claimed that when  our husband was alive, that I was very close to him  than any other of his wives including his (Joseph)  mother. He also claimed that because of my closeness  to him that I was able to get things from him more  than others. As a result he has been monitoring me.  Infact this one of the main reasons I want to take my children out of our country and any nearby country.  Thanking you in advance. Yours faithfully,  Deborah Kabila (Mrs.)  N/B: Kindly give me your direct telephone,fax and your mobile telephone numbers for  more explanations. ------------------------------------------------------------ http://Game.37.com/  <--- Free Games http://newJoke.com/   <---  J O K E S  ! ! ! --------------------------------------------------------------------- Express yourself with a super cool email address from BigMailBox.com.

Forex & Computer Operations Department
Tel/Fax: 234-9-2726223

Sir,

Accept my apologies for writing to you in this mode for it might be of inconvenience to you but due to my quest for an honest and reliable international assistance concerning a business here in my country Nigeria I have no other option than to go this length. I need the effectiveness of your professionalism in accomplishing this very business. I am DR. MOHAMMED BELLO Director/coordinator Forex and computer operations department of the Afex Bank of Africa PLC. 
I am writing this letter to ask your support and cooperation to carry out this business opportunity in my department.  We discovered an abandoned sum of $42.500,000.00 (forty two million, Five hundred thousand United States Dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our customer in Afex Bank of Nigeria, Late Monsieur. Ives Laurent (a French citizen and an Engineer executing major Federal contract with governments of West African sub region). He died with a fellow business associate in a ghastly auto crash last October and his remains have since been incarcerated. Since his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and put claims as the next of kin and beneficiary to the resources in Monsieur. Ives Laurent account, for it is against the ethics and norms of the finance institution to claim such resources without a beneficiary unless proclaimed by the government.
The federal government of Nigeria has given directives to finance institutions to declare adamant accounts that has stayed more than 8months in their custody as they intend to use it to pay off her military peace keeping force (ECOMOG) who fought in War ravaged African countries precisely and as the case may be, Late Monsieur. Ives Laurent account fell into this category thus the necessity for contacting you for I am determined to move this fund out as the rigorous and rash economic decision and policies has really turned we government workers to mere civil laborers. I have worked for almost a decade and half and I have nothing to show as reaps and rewards of my hard earned labor.        
As I need a next of kin/beneficiary and financial assistance to re-claim this resources for I cannot take on this project alone. My attorney and I have propose a commission of 25% out of the total resources for your kind assistance and five 5% has been mapped out to be reimbursed to both parties as sundry expenses incurred in the course of this business.
To commence this transaction, I require you to immediately indicate your interest by a return correspondence to this fax number 234-9-2726223 and enclose your private contact telephone number, fax number, full name & address, and your designated bank coordinates to enable us file a letter of claim to the appropriate departments for necessary approvals before the transfer could be made.  Note also that this business must be kept strictly confidential because of its nature and can be finalized within a short time depending on the level of your commitment/swiftness.
I look forward to receiving your prompt response.
Best regards, 

MOHAMMED BELLO (Ph.D)

KINDEST ATTENTION,

PLEASE PERMIT ME TO MAKE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE IN SO INFORMAL A MANNER.
THIS IS NECESSITATED BY MY URGENT NEED TO REACH A DEPENDABLE AND
TRUSTWORTHY FOREIGN PARTNER. THIS REQUEST MAY SEEM STRANGE AND
UNSOLICITED BUT I CRAVE YOUR INDULGENCE AND PRAY THAT YOU TAKE MY
REQUEST VERY SERIOUS.

I AM MR PETER WILLIAMS, A REKNOWNED BUSINESSMAN IN ONE OF THE
REBEL-HELD TOWNS, BOUAKE (ONE OF THE WAR ZONES IN IVORY COAST)
I RECEIVED INFORMATION FROM A RELIABLE SOURCE WHO DESCRIBED YOUR
COUNTRY AS BEING ECONOMICALLY CONDUCIVE FOR INVESTMENT
AND HER PEOPLE AS TRANSPARENT AND TRUSTWORTHY TO ENGAGING BUSINESS
WHICH MADE ME TO WRITE YOU. AS YOU MAY WANT TO KNOW
AND TO MAKE YOU LESS CURIOUS,I GOT YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS FROM AN
INTERNET SITE THAT PORTRAYED YOU (YOUR ESTABLISHMENT) IN GOOD
LIGHT.

ON THE 17TH OF SEPTEMBER 2002. THE REBEL LEADERS, UNTIL THEN WERE
LOYAL SOLDIERS TO THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT LAURENT GBAGBO 
CONTACTED ME IN MY OFFICE WITH THE BUSINESS OF IMPORTATION OF
ARMOURIES. WITHOUT THE PREMONITION OF WAR, I ACCEPTED THE JOB. THE
SOLDIERS PAID ME THE SUM OF TWENTY MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND
UNITED STATES DOLLARS (US$ 20.5) ON THE SPOT AND TOLD ME TO EXPEDITE
ACTION. SINCE I AM NOT INTO IMPORTATION OF ARMUNITIONS AND BECAUSE OF
THE URGENCY, I IMMEDIATELY STARTED MAKING SEVERAL CONTACTS WITH
BUSINESSMEN ACROSS THE GLOBE.

TWO DAYS LATER, HEAVY FIGHTING BROKE UP IN CENTRAL BAOUKE AND
KORHOGO, EVERYWHERE WAS IN DISSARRAY AND I LOST EVERYTHING THAT TOOK
ME SO MANY YEARS TO ACQUIRE. I HAVE NO OPTION THAN TO DO AWAY WITH
THE US$20.5M.


MY WIFE AND I QUICKLY MADE AN ARRANGEMENT WITH A RED CROSS RELIEF
WORKER WHO USED HIS OFFICIAL VAN TO MOVE THIS MONEY TO ABIDJAN,
ALTHOUGH HE DID NOT KNOW THE REAL CONTENT OF THE BOX.  PRESENTLY,
THIS FUND HAS BEEN DEPOSITED WITH A SAFE RELIABLE SECURITY COMPANY IN
ABIDJAN WHERE I AM HIDING FROM THE REBEL WHO DECLEARED ME WANTED. I
DO NOT WANT TO INVEST THIS MONEY IN ABIDJAN DUE TO UNFAVORABLE
ECONOMIC CLIMATE.  AS A RESULT, I KEPT THE MONEY IN A CUSTOM BONDED
WAREHOUSE WITH THE SECURITY COMPANY.  SO THAT I CAN NOT LAY MY HANDS
ON IT UNTIL
IT GETS TO YOUR COUNTRY, WHERE I WILL COMMENCE INVESTMENT.

THE ONLY ASSISTANCE WE NEED FROM YOU WHICH I BELIEVE
YOU WOULD DO FOR US ARE THE FOLLOWING:

1. MAKE IMMEDIATE ARRANGEMENT TO TAKE THE DELIVERY OF
THE CRATE (FUND) AT THEIR EUROPE OR AMERICAN
COMMISSION AGENTS.
2. ASSURANCE FROM YOU THAT YOU WILL NOT SIT ON OUR
SHARE WHEN THIS FUND GETS TO YOUR COUNTRY.

MY WIFE AND I AGREED THAT YOU SHALL BE ENTITLED TO 20% OF THE TOTAL
AMOUNT WHILE THE PRINCIPAL SUM WILL BE INVESTED IN A VIABLE BUSINESS
VENTURE WITH YOUR ADVICE. MOST IMPORTANTLY, I WILL LIKE TO BUY A
PERSONAL HOUSE WHERE MY WIFE, MY TWO SONS AND I WILL RESIDE.

UPON CONFIRMATION OF YOUR INTEREST TO HELP US AS OUR FOREIGN PARTNER
TO CLAIM THE CRATE FROM THE SECURITY COMPANY ON OUR BEHALF AT ANY OF
THEIR COMMISSION AGENT CLOSER TO YOU, I SHALL FURNISH YOU WITH THE
DETAILS OF THE MOVEMENT OF THE CONSIGNMENT TO BE SCHEDULED IN YOUR
FAVOUR BY THE SECURITY COMPANY PREPARE AN AIRWAY BILL AND TAG THE
CONSIGNMENT IN YOUR FAVOUR.  YOUR PRIVATE FAX AND TELEPHONE NUMBERS
ARE NEEDED TO ENHANCE THE SPEEDY CONCLUSION OF THIS TRANSACTION (OUR
ONLY HOPE IN LIFE NOW) URGENTLY.
KINDLY TREAT AS URGENT AND CONTACT ME IMMEDIATELY THROUGH THE ABOVE
E-MAIL ADDRESS {PANMENTAT@REDIFFMAIL.COM OR PANMENTAT@PHANTOMEMAIL.COM}.

Oliveira Savimbi <olivsav@netscape.net>,webmaster@aclweb.org,"Tue, 24 Dec 2002 16:52:18 -0000",PRIVATE EMAIL MESSAGE,"Good Day,

With warm heart I offer my friendship, and send my best wishes in this special season.

However strange or surprising this contact might seem to you, as we have not met personally or had any dealings in the past, I humbly ask that you take due consideration of its importance and immense benefit. I also sincerely seek your confidence, as I make this proposal to you as a person of integrity.

First and foremost I wish to introduce myself properly to you. My name is Oliveira Chuli Savimbi, I am a nephew and Personal Assistant to Late Jonas Malheiro Savimbi, leader of UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola). As led by my instinct, I selected your email address from an internet directory, in my search for a partner, hence this email. 

My Uncle(Mentor) was killed in a battle with government forces of Angola, led by President Dos Santos, on Friday 22nd February 2002. After his death, Mr. Antonio Dembo who was his second in command, assumed office as leader of UNITA, due to lack of the Charisma my Uncle had carried the party with in Dembo, there was chaos and struggle for leadership. Prominent members like Carlos Morgado lobbied to depose him and assume office as leader to enrich themselves and some of them who saw me as a threat to their ambitions, including Mr.Dembo, planned to kill me. The tension and confusion in UNITA become uncontrollable when Mr. Dembo died 10days after my Uncle's death. As I lost my mentor in this struggle which has been on for three decades now, not so much of this struggle interests me anymore, as there is now no sense of direction. I now desire a peaceful life, as I am no more interested in conflicts and wars. For this reason, I secretly left Angola and came here (Holland) to seek!
 political asylum.

I am sincerely proposing to you to render me your highly needed assistance in respect to safekeeping of some of my Uncle's money that arose from Diamonds sales. This money (US$18.5million), which was already on its way to my Uncle's Swiss Bank account, through the Diplomatic means we use to move money abroad, and was on transit with a private safe deposit security company here in Amsterdam, Holland in February when the tragic incident of my Uncle's death occurred. I then instructed the company to secure the consignment containing the money pending on further instructions from me. I have waited for sometime now for security reasons, and have now deicded to act with your reliable assistance. As a matter of fact, the reason I came to Holland and sought for political asylum here is the safe deposit. 

President Dos Santos has lobbied the International Community to freeze my Uncle's assets and accounts abroad, to ground UNITA, and has already done this in Angola. Hence I cannot lodge the funds in my name. Also I did not declare the funds to the here.

I plan to use this money to safeguard my future. It is very essential that you understand that the kind of trust and confidence I want to put in you is extraordinary, and an act of desperation on my part, in order not to lose this money. Also, ensure that this contact with you should be treated with utmost secrecy.

Your role in this project, is clearing the safety deposit containing the money which is deposited in my name, from the Security company, after which, the money will lodged into an account preferably a new account you should open for this transaction.  My share of the money will be returned to me when my asylum application in this country is granted, and I have permission to do business and open an account here. 

For your reliable assistance, I will reward you with 15%($2,775,000) of the money. 

I have with me, the Certificate of Deposit for the consignment containing the funds, which will be used for claim from the security company, and the release codes of the vaults. Also, everything will be legally processed for transfer of ownership to you, and this transaction should be completed immediately depending on your prompt response.

I thank you in advance as I anticipate your assistance in enabling me achieve this goal. 

Please contact me whether or not you are interested in assisting me. This will enable me scout for another partner in the event of non-interest on your part.

My name is Daniel Osondu an auditor at one of the Banks in lagos-Nigeria.  During our last audit exercise,some amount of money totalling $18.5Million was discovered and traced to be owned by one late Engineer Manfred Becker, a foreigner who died in a crash. The source of this fund was further traced to be a contract payment made to him but has remained unclaimed till now.Since his death, nobody has shown up to claim this fund and this attracted our curiosity.  I therefore made a research and found out that he did not leave any next of kin in his confidential document with the Ministry that he executed the contract for and also with our Bank. A panel setup by the Federal Government on recovery of funds expects that this fund should be unquestionably claimed by any of his available foreign next of kin or alternatively the fund should be donated for arms and ammunition at a military war college here in Nigeria. Fervent valuable efforts were made by the Panel to get in touch with any of the family or relatives but all have proved to no avail. It is because of the perceived possibility of not going to be able to locate any next of kin ( he had no wife and children) that the panel under the influence of our chairman, Rtd Major General Thomas Danababa , that arrangement is being made for the fund to be declared UNCLAIMABLED and then be donated to the Trust Fund for arms and ammunition which will further enhance the perpetration of war in Africa and the third world in general. To forestall this move, my colleagues and I have taken it upon ourselves to source for a foreign partner who could assist in claimimg this fund for further transfer abroad.  I have been given the sole mandate to source for a partner as soon as possible to that effect.All documents and proof to enable you get this fund have been carefully worked out and I am assuring you a 100% risk free involvement. Your share would be 30% of the total amount if you agree to assist while 10% would be set aside to offset all expenses in  course of the transfer and the rest would be for us for investment purposes in your country. If this proposal is OK by you, and you do wish to take the advantage of the trust we hope to bestow on you and your company, then kindly reach me immediately via my confidential fax number +23417597019 furnishing me with your most confidential telephone and fax numbers and exclusive email so that I can forward to you the relevant details of the transaction.

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO.

EMAIL:   williamsd1@rediff.com

Dear Friend,
 
SEEKING YOUR IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE.
Please Permit me to make your acquaintance in so
informal a manner. This is necessitated by my urgent
need to reach a dependable and trust wordy foreign
partner. This request may seem strange and
unsolicited but I will crave your indulgence and pray
that you view it seriously. My name is MR WILLIAMS DANIEL of the Democratic Republic of Congo and One of the
close aides to the former President of the Democratic
Republic of Congo LAURENT KABILA of blessed
memory, may his soul rest in peace.
 
Due to the military campaign of LAURENT KABILA to
force out the rebels in my country, I and some of my
colleagues were instructed by Late President Kabila
to  go abroad to purchase arms and ammunition worth of
Twenty Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States
Dollars only (US$20,500,000.00) to fight the rebel
group. But when President Kabila was killed in a
bloody shoot-out by one of his aide a day before we
were schedule to travel out of Congo, We immediately 
decided to divert the fund into a private security
company here in Congo for safe keeping. The security
of the said amount is presently being threatened here
following the arrest and seizure of properties of Col.
Rasheidi Karesava (One of the aides to Laurent Kabila)
a tribesman, and some other Military Personnel from
our same tribe, by the new President of the Democratic
Republic of Congo, the son of late President Laurent
Kabila, Joseph Kabila. 
In view of this, we need a reliable and trustworthy
foreign partner who can assist us to move this money
out of my country as the beneficiary.
WE have sufficient ''CONTACTS'' to move the fund under
Diplomatic Cover to a security company in the europe
in your name. This is to ensure that the Diplomatic
Baggage is marked ''CONFIDENTIAL'' and it  will not
pass through normal custom/airport screening and
clearance.
Our inability to move this money out of Congo all
This while lies on our lack of trust on our supposed
good friends (western countries) who suddenly became
hostile to those of us who worked with the late
President Kabila, immediately after his son took
office. Though we have neither seen nor met each
other, the information We gathered from an associate
who has worked in your country has encouraged and
convinced us that with your sincere assistance, this
transaction will be properly handled with modesty
and honesty to a huge success within two weeks. The
said money is a state fund and therefore requires a
total confidentiality.
Thus, if you are willing to assist us move this fund
out of Congo, you can contact me through my email
address above with your telephone, fax number and
personal information to enable us discuss the
modalities and what will be your share
(percentage) for assisting us.
I must use this opportunity and medium to implore You
to exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this Matter
extraordinarily confidential, Whatever your Decision,
while I await your prompt response. Thank you and
GodBless.
 
Best Regards
MR WILLIAMS DANIEL

Attn.:  The President/CEO


I am  Dr. (Mrs.) Maryam Abacha, wife to the late
Nigeria Head of State - General Sani Abacha. I am
proposing this business to you because we could be of
great assistance to each other, likewise developing a
cordial business relatinship.

I currently have within my reach the sum of Twenty-Five
Million, Six Hundred Thousand United States Dollars 
(US$25,600,000:00)cash which I intend to 
use for investment purpose specifically in your country. 

This money came as a result of a pay back contract 
deal between my late husband and a Russian firm 
on our country's Multi-billion Dollars Ajaokuta Steel Plant. 

The Russian partners returned my husband's share of
US$25.6 million after his death and lodged it with my
husband's security firm in Nigeria of which I am adirector.
Right now, the new civilian government has revoked our
licenses that allow us to own a financial and oil
company. 

In view of this, I acted very fast to
withdraw the US$25.6 million from the company's vault
well preserved and packaged in trunk boxes and
deposited it in  ECOWAS Security Bank. I have since
declared our  security company bankrupt. No record 
ever  existed concerning the money neither is the
money traceable by the government because there is no
document showing that we received the money from the
Russians.

Due to the current situation in the country concerning
the government attitude towards my family, it has
become quite impossible for me to make use of the
money within, thus I seek your assistance to move the
money out of this country. On your consent, I shall
expect you to contact me urgently to enable us discuss
in detail about this transaction. Bearing in mind that
your assistance is needed to transfer this fund.
Your urgent response is highly needed.  All
correspondences must be channeled to our legal adviser

Leonard Obi Esq  through  his direct Tel. No:

234-1-4705964. I must also use this opportunity to
implore you to exercise the utmost indulgence to keep
this transaction a confidential issue. You can also
contact me directly on  my secret  telephone:-234-1-4705964
if there is need.

Thanks and God bless you.
